# Introduction: Beyond Digital Theater - A New Path for Enterprise Change

In 2023, enterprises worldwide spent over $3.4 trillion on digital transformation initiatives. By the end of 2024, analysts estimate that 70% of these efforts will fail to deliver their promised value. If you're reading this book, you've probably experienced this firsthand – either watching millions dissolve into failed programs or struggling to deliver real change within a system that seems designed to prevent it.

This book exists because we need to stop pretending.

We need to stop pretending that our current approaches to portfolio, program, and project management work in a world where value creation has fundamentally changed. We need to stop pretending that implementing another framework or hiring more consultants will solve our problems. Most importantly, we need to stop pretending that digital transformation is primarily about technology.

## Why This Book? Why Now?

The gap between how enterprises manage change and how successful organizations create value has never been wider. While startups and tech companies have embraced product thinking, continuous delivery, and value stream-based organizations, large enterprises remain trapped in project-based thinking that was outdated twenty years ago.

The rise of AI has only made this more apparent. Organizations are rushing to "transform" with AI without understanding that technology is merely a tool, not a solution. They're repeating the same mistakes they made with Agile, with Digital, with Cloud – treating systemic organizational challenges as if they were purely technical problems.

This book is your guide to breaking this cycle.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this book, you will understand:

1. Why traditional portfolio and project management actively destroy value in modern organizations
2. How to move from project-based to product-based value creation
3. The real reasons most transformations fail (hint: it's not resistance to change)
4. Practical techniques for creating lasting organizational change
5. How to use tools like AI effectively without falling into the technology trap
6. Ways to measure and demonstrate value that actually matter

More importantly, you'll learn how to:

- Build adaptive organizations that don't need periodic "transformation"
- Create governance structures that enable rather than control
- Lead change without relying on positional authority
- Make technology serve your business instead of driving it
- Deliver real value consistently and sustainably

## How This Book Is Different

This isn't a book about project management methodologies or transformation frameworks. It doesn't offer easy answers or prescriptive solutions. Instead, it provides:

- A clear-eyed analysis of why current approaches fail
- Practical alternatives based on real-world success stories
- Tools for thinking differently about organizational change
- Techniques for creating lasting value in complex organizations
- Ways to navigate the political and human aspects of change

Each chapter concludes with a Socratic dialogue that challenges you to apply these ideas to your specific context. These aren't academic exercises – they're designed to help you translate theory into practice.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book is for:

- Executives trying to create real organizational change
- Portfolio and program managers seeking better ways to deliver value
- Product leaders building modern delivery organizations
- Change agents fighting organizational inertia
- Consultants who want to create lasting impact
- Anyone tired of transformation theater

If you're looking for a book that will help you get better at managing projects the traditional way, this isn't it. But if you want to understand how to create real change in modern organizations, keep reading.

## How to Use This Book

Each part builds on the previous ones, but you can read them independently based on your needs:

Part I (Dismantling the Machine) helps you understand why current approaches fail and what to do about it.

Part II (Building Something Better) introduces new ways of thinking about organization and value creation.

Part III (Tools for Change) provides practical techniques and approaches for implementing these ideas.

Part IV (Making It Real) shows you how to make this work in your organization.

The Socratic dialogues at the end of each chapter help you apply these ideas to your specific context. They're designed to make you uncomfortable – real change usually is.

## A Note on AI and Technology

Throughout this book, we'll look at how technologies like AI can support organizational change. However, we'll treat them as tools in service of business objectives, not solutions in themselves. The fundamental challenges of organizational change are human and systemic, not technical.

## The Journey Ahead

This book won't give you easy answers. It won't provide a step-by-step guide to transformation. What it will do is help you think differently about how organizations create value and give you tools to create real, lasting change.

The ideas in this book have been tested in some of the world's largest organizations. They work – not because they're easy to implement, but because they address the real challenges of modern organizations.

Are you ready to move beyond transformation theater and create real change? Turn the page. Let's begin.
